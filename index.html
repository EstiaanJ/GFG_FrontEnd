        <h3>Transferring to a player account, or an NPC you've transferred to before:</h3> 
        <p>
        Enter the name of the account (the character name) you are transferring to in the "Transfer to Account Name" field. 
        The name must be exact, including capitalization.
        If the name entered is wrong the transfer will go through but they won't receive the money.
        </p>
        <h3>Transferring to an NPC you've never transferred to:</h3> 
        <p>
         Enter the name of the NPC, make sure it's right so that future transfers to that NPC will work.
